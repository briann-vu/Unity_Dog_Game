Game was made in Unity using pefabs given by our GAME 350 proffessor. In this project we learned about collision and time; we implemented collision with the food items dropping on to the dog object and we used time to drop the foods every x seconds. Steaks drop every two seconds while cookies drop every three, and once they collide with the floor they despawn in .4 seconds giving the player a chance to still pick it up once it has fallen. If the player eats 10 steaks before 30 seconds, the game will end and they win, but if they can't do that or eat one cookie the game will also end, but the player loses. Bone objects will spawn on the ground every time the player eats a steak, this is to keep score. At the moment there isn't an indicator of winning or not, but that will soon be implemented.
